                        random background colours and allows users to customize and
                        copy the generated colour code.

                    <p>A landing page is one of the best web development projects for
                        beginners. A foundational understanding of HTML and CSS is
                        required. You will learn how to add columns, divide sections,
                        arrange items, add headers, footers. Create an impressive page
                        using your creativity. It is important to pay attention to the
                        alignment, the padding, the color palette, and boxes. Make sure CSS doesn't overlap elements</p>
